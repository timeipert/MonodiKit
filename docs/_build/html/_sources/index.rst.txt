Welcome to MonodiKit's documentation!
=====================================

MonodiKit is a Python library designed to facilitate the analysis
and processing of medieval chant documents. It was specifically
tailored to handle data in the monodi+ data format as edited
by the Corpus Monodicum project.
The library offers a set of classes that
provide a wide range of functionalities,
including parsing and processing of chant documents,
exploring their hierarchical structure,
managing metadata, generating musical notation,
and extracting relevant information.
